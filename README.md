# validation_form

This code creates a simple HTML form with three input fields: name, email, and password. The validateForm() function is called when the form is submitted, and it checks that all three fields are filled out and that the password is at least 8 characters long.

The function first retrieves the values of the name, email, and password fields using the document.forms object. It then checks each field for validity using a series of if statements. If any of the fields are invalid, the function displays an alert message and returns false, which prevents the form from being submitted. If all fields are valid, the function returns true, and the form is submitted as usual.
